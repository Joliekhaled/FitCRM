Option 1 — GitHub Pages:
1. Push repository to GitHub (public).
2. Go to repo → Settings → Pages → Select `main` branch and `/root` (or `/docs`) folder → Save.
3. Wait a minute, then your site will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

- Add Client, Edit, and Delete are placeholders per assignment (no server/persistence required).
- The search box filters the table client-side.
- Code is commented and organized.
